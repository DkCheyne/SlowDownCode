During testing and competition it was found that both series of motors that vex offers can easly overheat. Even while running under spec.
Through trial and error and the work of Mr. Payson and Zach's research porjects into the power curves of the motors. It was decided that 
the best way to handle this problem was to limet the amount of change in positive acceleration on the motors (jerk). Two methodoligies 
were set forth to solve this problem. First being to train the drivers to not jam their sticks forward and overwhelm the motor while 
driving. The second was to create a software hard stop to create a smoothing effect on the jerk attempting to limet the heating of 
the motors.
